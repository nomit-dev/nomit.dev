            <p>Ever since I started working for myself (since March this year) I've been having a motivational problem.</p>
            <p>My initial ideas went out to try to create one or multiple SaaS products. However, every idea I started I lost
               motivation halfway through. The worst problem for me was that I didn't believe in my products.
            </p>
            <p>
                You might say.. &quot;well Timon, then create something the people want!&quot;. I've been open about my ideas and products to everyone
                who asked (and some who didn't, heh). People liked the ideas, wanted me to keep them in the loop and wanted to be the first beta testers, so this wasn't really a problem.
                So why was I still not motivated? Why couldn't I get rid of this aching feeling in my stomach?
                I realized I could just do this, probably make money, hopefully enough to live on. Improve my products, keep marketing them, and improve my own standards of living that way.
                However, I don't really need to improve my own standards of living. I am priviliged to live in a lovely country, in a nice house etc. So, what would be the point in getting more money?
            </p>
            <p>I've been concerned with climate change for quite a while, and I've been asking myself what I could personally do as a developer to help out. 
                Then a couple of days ago when I couldn't sleep, I was browsing around on volunteering websites. 
                I saw a couple of listings where a non-profit asked for a web developer to create and maintain there website. 
                My brain got triggered and I started searching and looking around some more. Alot of websites seemed to have some sort of Wix website, with some text, some videos (alot of them badly embedded), stretched images.
                I could see the struggle on some pages, misalignment, some excel images instead of graphs etc. Non-profits wanted to get their message of their non-profit accross, but where struggling with the tools they got.
                After all, most of them don't have a lot of money so they tend to use free tools and rely on developers who want to help out in their free time.</p>
                
            <p>And I realised.. this is what I want to do. THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO DO. I would love to help out these non-profits to spread their message.
               In different ways: Helping with the creation of their website, helping with the creation of assets: images, flyers, and maybe even logo's.
            </p>
            <p>So I present to you: <em>spread your message</em>. <em>*cough*</em> Well yeah, it isn't much yet. Just a name really.</p>
            <p>I've come up with some ideas for my MVP (Minimum Viable Product). And I'll try to keep blogging (mainly for myself, my website has zero visitors right now) ideas and progress.</p>
